![a7a9710e9dacbe01868099b8c68ec57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50535321/213139546-4770f078-fbac-4651-b455-cd9d586987b1.jpg)

The main function of this plug-in is to enable the camera in UE4 to detect the facial attributes in the camera, including the contours of the facial features, the key points of the face, eyes, nose and mouth, and to know whether the face is a man or a woman's weight (0-0.5 is a woman, 0.5-1 is a man), as well as the approximate age weight of the face. The project includes a Demo of the plugin that can be used directly. Note: Under the editor, you also need to manually copy the contents of the Dependence folder to the root directory of the engine（..\Epic Games\UE_4.27\Engine\Binaries\Win64）. In the case of an exe, you would have to manually copy the contents of the Dependence folder to the root directory of the exe（..\project name\Binaries\Win64）.
